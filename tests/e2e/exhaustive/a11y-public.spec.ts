/**
 * a11y-public.spec.ts — runs axe-core (the same engine our scanner uses) against
 * EVERY public route to verify AccessiScan eats its own dog food.
 *
 * Sells the product. We market WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. If our marketing site
 * fails axe-core, the demo screenshot a prospect takes shows that.
 *
 * Tag scope: 'wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa' — matches the
 * AA-level claim the scanner makes against customer sites.
 *
 * Severity gate: assertion fails on `critical` and `serious` violations.
 * `moderate` and `minor` are reported but not blocking — those are stylistic
 * fixes that should not block prod deploys for the marketing site.
